Samle Curl Command to POST data to Google Sheet called email-form

curl -s -i -X POST 'https://admin.hlx.page/form/jwtnewbie/franklin-demo/main/email-form.json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"data":{"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Wong","gender":"F","age":"28"}}'


The following URL http://localhost:3000/?createCollection=y

Will run the code in /scripts/scripts.js function function checkCreateCollection()

which calls the function getEmailForm()

in forms-test.js and runs function getEmailForm()

which reads the data from email-form.json resolves to https://main--franklin-demo--jwtnewbie.hlx.live/email-form.json

So the data in Spread Sheet email-form
